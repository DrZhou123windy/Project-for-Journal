In file [ lar_ algorithm. m ] ,  lines 44 and 45 indicate that the model generated based on inv(G_active) * ones(p_active, 1)) may have slower generation speed and lower accuracy than the model generated by nv(G_active) \ones(p_active, 1)). When using this model, please modify the code according to your own needs.
In addition, line 61 suggests that the path variable may need to change the iteration size of each loop, and it is necessary to consider pre allocating the model speed.

Part of the code has been polished in conjunction with AI, and users can make necessary modifications as needed
